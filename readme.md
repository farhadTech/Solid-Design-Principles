# 🌟 SOLID Design Principles Explained

![SOLID Principles](images/solid.png)

**SOLID** is a widely used set of design principles in object-oriented software development. These principles help developers write maintainable, scalable, and robust code.

## 📌 What is SOLID?
The SOLID principles were introduced by **Robert C. Martin** in his 2000 paper, _"Design Principles and Design Patterns."_ The **SOLID** acronym was later coined by **Michael Feathers**, and over the past two decades, these principles have revolutionized object-oriented programming.

**In essence, SOLID helps us:**
✔️ Write cleaner, modular, and reusable code.
✔️ Reduce complexity and improve maintainability.
✔️ Make applications easier to extend and modify.

## 🔥 The Five SOLID Principles
Each letter in **SOLID** represents an essential principle of software design:

1️⃣ **[Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](/Single%20Responsibility%20Principle/srp.md)**
   _A class should have only one reason to change._

2️⃣ **[Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](/Open%20Closed%20Design%20Principle/readme.md)**
   _Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification._

3️⃣ **[Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](/Liskov%20Substitue%20Principle/readme.md)**
   _Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes._

4️⃣ **[Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](/Interface%20Segregation%20Principle/readme.md)**
   _Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use._

5️⃣ **[Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](/Dependency%20Inversion%20Principle/readme.md)**
   _Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations._

## 🚀 Why Use SOLID?
✅ Helps manage **complexity** in large applications.
✅ Encourages **scalability** and **extensibility**.
✅ Improves **testability** and **code reusability**.
✅ Reduces **tight coupling** between components.

By following SOLID principles, developers can create software that is **easier to understand, modify, and maintain** over time! 🎯

# SOLID Design Principles Explained:

**SOLID is one of the most popular sets of design principles in object-oriented software development. It's a mnemonic acronym for the following five design principles:**

**1. Single Responsibility Principle <br>
2. Open/Closed Principle <br>
3. Liskov Substitution Principle <br>
4. Interface Segregation Principle <br>
5. Dependency Inversion <br>**

>The solid principles are a set of best practices, transformed into a set of rules after dozens of years of cumulative development experience around the world done by Software professionals.
<br>
The SOLID principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper "Design Principles and Design Patterns." These concepts were later built upon by Michael Feathers, who introduced us to the SOLID acronym. And in the last 20 years, these five principles have revolutionized the world of object-oriented programming, changing the way that we write software.
<br><br>
So, what is SOLID and how does it help us write better code? <br>
** Simply put, Martin and Feaher's design principles encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. consequently, as our applications grow in size, we can reduce their complexity and save ourselves a lot of headaches further down the road! **
